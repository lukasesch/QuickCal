# QuickCal
QuickCal is an iOS app designed to help users track their nutrition and calculate personalized calorie and macronutrient goals. The app is built using the SwiftUI framework, follows the MVVM architectural pattern, and stores user data with Core Data. By integrating external food databases via REST APIs (OpenFoodFacts), users can easily search for foods and scan barcodes, supported by the AVFoundation framework.
User privacy is a top priority — no personal data ever leaves the app, ensuring complete data security.

## 🛠 Development Phase
This app is part of my project work for the Master's program in Computer Science at Trier University of Applied Sciences and is currently in beta. Future updates will bring new features and improvements.

## 🌍 Data Source
QuickCal operates using the open-source database **OpenFoodFacts**, which contains a wide range of food items maintained and expanded by the community.
